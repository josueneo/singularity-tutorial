# Welcome to Singularity Tutorial

You've heard about containers before, but don't really know much about them. What exactly are they?

Singularity containers are a new type of container designed specifically for HPC applications. The HPC community has long struggled with managing resources across multiple nodes. In addition, running large numbers of jobs simultaneously requires careful coordination between schedulers and job managers. This often leads to complex systems that are difficult to manage and debug.

In this course you will learn what Singularity is, how to install it, how to use it and how to take advantage of its features.

The tutorial examples and code excerpts are written in compatibility with version 3.10 of SingularityCE or SingularityPRO.
